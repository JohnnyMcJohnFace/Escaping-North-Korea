      Some Background
    </h2>




    <p>
      On the twenty-fifth of June, 1950, the exceptionally bloody conflict known as the Korean War ensued. Although the war was relatively short, an estimated five million people were killed. More than half of these deaths were civilian deaths which accounted for about ten percent of prewar Korea's population; a higher number of civilian casualties than World War II and the Vietnam War. The two main players in the war were the communism supportive north, backed by China and the Soviet Union, and the anti-communist South, backed by the United States and the United Nations. Both side's motivation to enter the war was to spread the form of government that they thought was ideal for a country to have. The countries of the United Nations feared the spread of communism whereas the Soviet Union believed that democracy was deeply flawed. Battle raged for three years until the twenty-seventh of June, 1953, when the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed. This agreement marked the creation of the demilitarized zone,         &#40;DMZ&#41; which is the 155.3 mile strip of land running across the Korean peninsula that splits the country in two at the 38th parallel.

      Although fighting ceased with the passing of the Armistice Agreement, a peace treaty or surrender never took place. To this day, there is still bad blood between the combatants of the war. The current dictator of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, and former US President Donald Trump have threatened destruction with nuclear weapons multiple times, and the relationship between the US, and China, and Russia is weird and mysterious. "Rocket man is on a suicide mission," is just one of Mr. Trump's most well-known threats.

      One of the most notable parts of the war was the large number of Koreans living in the Soviet-occupied North that attempted to escape to the South. To this day, thousands of Koreans attempt to defect from North Korea every year. In 2017, a total of 31,093 defectors had successfully defected to South Korea since the end of the war. On this website, you'll see my grandfather's personal story of how his family fled to the South.

      To gain some more information about his experience, I decided to interview him. I asked him ten basic questions about what it was like.

    <ol>
      <li>
        Tell me more about Soviet presence on the Korean peninsula.

      <li>
        Do you remember what it was like living in the north?
      </li>
      <li>
        How old were you when you fled?

        How did your family escape the north?

        What were some of the risks and obstacles that you had to overcome?
      </li>

      During World War II, Japan had been massively expanding in East Asia; invading multiple other neighboring lands. This includes the Korean peninsula. However, the people of Korea weren't going down without a fight. Over 200,000 resistance fighters took up arms against the Japanese. Many resistance leaders had adopted the Communist ideologies of nearby Russia, which had been stretching its influence across northern Korea for decades. One of those leaders was Kim Il Sung; who would later become a very important figure in North Korea.
    </p>




    <p>
      After WWII ended, the United Nations held an election to establish a democracy throughout the Korean peninsula. But the Soviets refused to comply. They feared that free elections would weaken their strong influence in the north. Thus, the election only took place in the southern half of Korea.
    </p>




    <p>
      The Soviet Union went a very different direction; installing Kim as their puppet in North Korea. Capitalizing on his Communist and anti-democracy ideals, and Korean origins.
    </p>




    <p>
      Kim used art and propaganda to brainwash his citizens to believe in Communist ideals. He also emphasized war over human rights and his propaganda portrayed Korean military might and often shunned the United States.

      This heavily goes against Christian belief. For Christians, God should be held above all others and that eternal life is achieved through peace and respect for God. Many resisted which led to a genocide of Christians in the area. Because Christians were a targeted group of people, the majority of people leaving the country were Christian because they wanted to continue their way of life.

      To escape, my grandpa's family left on an American military train. There were five of them: my grandpa, his two older brothers, his older sister, and two parents. He was only five years old when his family escaped. However, instead of riding inside the train, his family rode on the top. Yes, on the roof. Hundreds of other citizens rode on top of the trains as well even though it meant certain death if they were to fall off. He said the train would not stop along the way from station to station. If someone fell off, no one cared. The train kept moving. He also said that one cousin of his never made it to South Korea because of this reason.

      In North Korea, my grandfather had lived a prosperous life. He said he recalls his family living in a big house with a farm and a big apple orchard. His dad was also a very famous pastor in North Korea.

      His family never intended to leave the north for good. That's why they never brought any belongings with them on the trains. His parents thought after a couple of weeks or so, they could return home and continue living their lives the way that they had been. However, we all know that wasn't the case since fighting continued until 1953. After spending months in a refugee camp, his family opened a small business selling traditional Korean snacks such as kimbap, yeot, and dried squid bites. He remembers his two older brothers, sister, and father going out to sell the food they made.

      They eventually made enough money to start a church in Seoul; the capital of South Korea. However, Their story doesn't stop here. My grandfather would eventually immigrate again to California in the United States where he'd start a family. He currently resides in the San Francisco Bay Area.

      About This Website
    </h2>




    <p>
      This website was created for a seventh-grade history class project where we were assigned to present a family experience that is connected to some part of history so this is what I decided to do. It's a simple website, but it was still fun to make. I think I learned a lot doing this project. Pretty much everything about my grandpa's escape story I didn't previously know so I'm really glad that I chose to interview him because it's a very intriguing story. 
    </p>




    <p>
      Also, before I did this project, I don't think I really understood how hard it is to escape North Korea. Like it was dangerous enough back then, especially during a war, but nowadays, it's getting harder and harder. Last year, only 195 North Koreans successfully defected. An 80% decrease since the year before. It feels good knowing that my family is capable of amazing things.
